# Thesis Project Web Application
## Project Overview
We created a web application for Charles Darwin University to manage and display thesis topics for IT students. The application has two main components:

1. Thesis Topic Class
A Python class named ThesisTopic was crafted, encapsulating details such as topic number, areas of study, title, and supervisor information.
2. Views and Templates
List View: A summary list of thesis topics was made using Django views and Bootstrap for styling. This list includes clickable titles that lead to more details.
Detail View: Detailed information about each thesis topic is shown on a separate page, with a layout that neatly presents all the attributes of a topic.

## Features
Dynamic URLs: We configured Django URL patterns to accept topic IDs and display corresponding details.
Bootstrap Integration: The UI is designed with Bootstrap, providing a responsive and attractive layout.
